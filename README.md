# SoundSim Project

Final project for CS591: Seminar on Computational Audio
Worked with Sanam Patel (patels95)

For this project, we developed an analysis of different instrument sounds and attempted to simulate them using the ASDR envelope. Samples were taken from the Philharmonic orchestra in London. Our attempt to simulate the sound was by analyzing each instrument's spectrum and signal. For each instrument group, we tried to apply similar characteristics that are shared by all instruments in each particular family (vibrato, amplitude shaping, ASDR envelope, etc...)

The website to view all the sounds and descriptions are: https://derekmei.github.io/soundsim/index.html
For each instrument, we display the original wav file, a short write-up of our research and how we created the simulated file, and then display the signal and spectrum for the original wav file. Afterward, we display our version of the wav file and discuss what still needs to be done to truly copy the sound of the original sound clip.
